# Code Coverage Report

This project maintains comprehensive test coverage to ensure code quality and reliability.

## Coverage Reports

Coverage reports are automatically generated by our GitHub Actions CI pipeline on every test run. You can download the latest coverage reports from the [test workflow artifacts](https://github.com/elong0527/demo_eval_metric/actions/workflows/test.yml).

## How to Access Coverage Reports

1. Visit the [GitHub Actions test workflow](https://github.com/elong0527/demo_eval_metric/actions/workflows/test.yml)
2. Click on the latest successful run
3. Scroll down to the "Artifacts" section
4. Download the `coverage-report-<python-version>` artifact
5. Extract and open `htmlcov/index.html` in your browser

## Coverage by Module

The test suite covers the following key modules:

- **core/metric_define.py**: Core metric definitions and validation
- **core/metric_helpers.py**: Helper functions for metric creation  
- **core/metric_registry.py**: Unified registry for all expressions (errors, metrics, selectors)
- **evaluation/metric_evaluator.py**: Main evaluation engine
- **evaluation/config.py**: Configuration management

## Running Coverage Locally

To generate a coverage report locally:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-cov

# Run tests with coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=src/polars_eval_metrics --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# View HTML report
open htmlcov/index.html  # On macOS
# or
xdg-open htmlcov/index.html  # On Linux
```

## Coverage Goals

We aim to maintain:
- **Overall coverage**: > 80%
- **Critical modules**: > 90%
- **New features**: 100% coverage required

## Contributing

When contributing new features or bug fixes:

1. Write tests for all new code
2. Ensure existing tests pass
3. Check coverage doesn't decrease
4. Add integration tests for complex features

## Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline automatically:
- Runs tests on multiple Python versions (3.11, 3.12)
- Generates HTML coverage reports
- Uploads coverage artifacts for download
- Runs linting and type checks
